# Employee_Managment:
Signup:

New employees can register/sign up for an account by providing necessary details such as name, email, password, and other relevant information.
The system should validate the provided information, ensuring uniqueness of email addresses and adherence to password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).


Signin:

Registered employees can sign in to their accounts using their email and password.
The system authenticates the user's credentials and grants access to the employee dashboard upon successful authentication.
Security measures such as encryption and session management should be implemented to protect user credentials and sessions.


Update Profile:

Employees should be able to update their profile information such as contact details, address, emergency contacts, and any other relevant information.
The system should allow users to change their password securely and update any other personal information as needed.


Delete Account:

Employees should have the option to delete their account if they no longer require access to the system.
Upon deletion, the system should prompt the user to confirm their decision and possibly provide a reason for deleting the account.
Deleted accounts should be securely removed from the system, and associated data should be appropriately handled based on data retention policies.
